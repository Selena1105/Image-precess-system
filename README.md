# Image-precessing-system

This project implements an image processing system to convert a color image to a grayscale image and apply various transformations.

## Features

- Convert the color image to a grayscale image
- Use a 6-segment linear transformation on the grayscale image
- Display each layer of the grey scale and draw the corresponding histogram
- Convert the grayscale image to an embossed effect by extracting the edges of the image using multiple filters
